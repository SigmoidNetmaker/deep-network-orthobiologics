# deep-network-orthobiologics

This repository contains MATLAB m-files that trains various deep networks on orthobiologics data. 
It also contains an Excel file that holds all the orthobiologics data in our dataset. 

The code, and further code derived from it, were used in for the project described in:
Anastasio AT, Zinger BS, Anastasio TJ (in revision) A novel application of neural networks to identify Potentially effective combinations of biologic factors for enhancement of bone fusion/repair

Following is the list of files and a brief description of what they do:

OrthoSetUp.m  -- sets up all of the network types for training
